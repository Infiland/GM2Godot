## What GM2Godot Is and Isn't

**GM2Godot is:**
- A modern asset conversion tool from GameMaker to Godot
- A time-saver for starting Godot projects from GameMaker
- A tool for developers who want to migrate their projects

**GM2Godot isn't:**
- A perfect 1:1 conversion tool
- A GML to GDScript transpiler *(yet)*
- A tool for converting compiled GM projects (use [UndertaleToolMod](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) instead)

## Releases
Downloadable releases can be found on the side of this page, for now executables are only available on Windows but we will work on other platforms too
